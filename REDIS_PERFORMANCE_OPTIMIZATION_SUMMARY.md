- **Features**:
  - `RedisPerformanceMonitor` class for tracking operation metrics
  - Real-time performance statistics collection
  - Operation timing monitoring with slow operation detection (>10ms)
  - Error rate tracking and alerting

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Redis Client (`app/utils/redis_client.py`)

#### Performance Monitoring
```python
class RedisPerformanceMonitor:
    - Operation timing tracking
    - Error rate calculation
    - Performance statistics generation
    - Slow operation detection
```

#### Optimized Connection Pool
```python
self.connection_pool = redis.ConnectionPool.from_url(
    settings.REDIS_URL,
    max_connections=50,  # Increased for higher concurrency
    socket_connect_timeout=3,  # Faster connection timeout
    socket_timeout=2,  # Faster operation timeout
    socket_keepalive=True,
    health_check_interval=15,  # More frequent health checks
)
```

#### Performance Monitoring Integration
- All Redis operations now include performance monitoring
- Automatic slow operation detection and logging
- Performance statistics accessible via `get_performance_stats()`

### 2. Redis Performance Service (`app/services/redis_performance_service.py`)

#### Comprehensive Performance Analysis
- **Performance Reports**: Detailed analysis of Redis performance metrics
- **Connection Pool Optimization**: Analysis and recommendations for pool sizing
- **Cache Pattern Analysis**: Usage pattern analysis for optimization
- **Performance Alerts**: Automated alerting for performance issues

#### Key Features
```python
class RedisPerformanceService:
    - get_comprehensive_performance_report()
    - optimize_connection_pool()
    - analyze_cache_patterns()
    - monitor_operation_performance()
```

### 3. Enhanced Celery Configuration (`app/core/celery_app.py`)

#### Optimized Transport Options
```python
broker_transport_options={
    'max_connections': 50,  # Increased connection pool
    'socket_connect_timeout': 3,  # Faster connection timeout
    'socket_timeout': 2,  # Faster operation timeout
    'health_check_interval': 15,  # More frequent health checks
}

worker_prefetch_multiplier=2,  # Increased for better throughput
```

### 4. Enhanced Health Check Service (`app/services/health_check_service.py`)

#### Performance Metrics Integration
- Health checks now include performance metrics
- Connection pool statistics in health reports
- Performance thresholds monitoring
- Detailed Redis server metrics

### 5. API Endpoints for Performance Monitoring (`app/main.py`)

#### New Monitoring Endpoints
- `GET /monitoring/redis/performance` - Comprehensive performance report
- `GET /monitoring/redis/connection-pool` - Connection pool analysis
- `GET /monitoring/redis/cache-patterns` - Cache usage pattern analysis

## Performance Improvements Achieved

### Connection Pool Optimization
- **Before**: 20 max connections, 30s health checks
- **After**: 50 max connections, 15s health checks
- **Result**: Better concurrency handling and faster failure detection

### Timeout Optimization
