# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical Redis connection issues identified in the deployed Reddit Content Platform backend API. The current system shows Redis and Celery connection failures that prevent caching, session management, and background task processing from functioning properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Redis Connection Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Redis connection to be stable and properly configured, so that caching and session management work reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the Redis client SHALL establish a successful connection to the Redis server
2. WHEN the health check endpoint is called THEN Redis SHALL report as "healthy" with proper connection status
3. WHEN Redis operations are performed THEN they SHALL complete without coroutine-related errors
4. IF Redis connection fails THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Celery Worker Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Celery background workers to connect properly to Redis, so that asynchronous tasks like content generation and crawling can be processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Celery workers start THEN they SHALL successfully connect to the Redis broker
2. WHEN background tasks are queued THEN Celery SHALL process them without connection errors
3. WHEN the health check is performed THEN Celery SHALL report as "healthy" with active worker status
4. IF Celery connection fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be logged for debugging

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Redis connection settings to be properly configured for the Railway production environment, so that the service can connect using the correct host, port, and credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads configuration THEN it SHALL use the correct Redis connection parameters from Railway environment variables
2. WHEN connecting to Redis THEN the system SHALL use the internal Railway Redis service URL
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use the provided Redis password
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: Health Monitoring Improvement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed health monitoring for Redis and Celery services, so that I can quickly identify and resolve connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL provide detailed status information for Redis and Celery
2. WHEN services are healthy THEN the overall system health SHALL report as "healthy"
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN specific error messages SHALL be provided for troubleshooting
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN response times and connection metrics SHALL be tracked

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to continue functioning even when Redis is temporarily unavailable, so that core functionality remains accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis is unavailable THEN core API functionality SHALL continue to work without caching
2. WHEN Redis reconnects THEN caching functionality SHALL automatically resume
3. WHEN Celery tasks fail due to Redis issues THEN they SHALL be retried with exponential backoff
4. IF Redis remains unavailable THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings but not crash

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Redis operations to be optimized for the production environment, so that the application performs efficiently under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Redis connections are established THEN connection pooling SHALL be properly configured
2. WHEN multiple Redis operations occur THEN they SHALL use efficient connection management
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN Redis operations SHALL not become a bottleneck
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN Redis response times SHALL be within acceptable limits (< 100ms)
