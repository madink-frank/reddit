# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Reddit Content Platform dashboard with comprehensive web crawling analytics, natural language processing (NLP), and image analysis capabilities inspired by HashScraper's dashboard approach. The improvements focus on providing real-time data collection monitoring, advanced text analysis including morphological analysis and sentiment analysis, image content detection with OCR capabilities, and intuitive data visualization tools that enable users to extract meaningful insights from Reddit content with simple click-based interactions.
