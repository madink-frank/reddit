# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin dashboard frontend is not loading properly in the local development environment. Users are experiencing a blank page when accessing localhost:5173, preventing local development and testing. This spec addresses the need to diagnose and fix the frontend development environment issues to ensure developers can work locally with the admin dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin dashboard to load properly in my local development environment, so that I can develop and test features locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `npm run dev` in the admin-dashboard directory THEN the development server SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN a developer navigates to localhost:5173 THEN the admin dashboard SHALL display the login page or redirect appropriately
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved and loaded
4. WHEN the React application initializes THEN there SHALL be no JavaScript errors in the browser console
5. IF there are missing dependencies THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be installed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging information in the development environment, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed in the browser console with clear stack traces
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the errors SHALL be logged with appropriate context
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the build process SHALL fail with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL provide fallback values or clear warnings
5. WHEN the application fails to load THEN the browser SHALL display a meaningful error message instead of a blank page

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to properly connect to the deployed backend API, so that I can test the full application functionality locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN they SHALL be directed to the correct backend URL (Railway deployment)
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the frontend SHALL properly handle the OAuth flow with Reddit
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN CORS issues occur THEN they SHALL be properly handled or documented for resolution
5. IF the API base URL is incorrect THEN the application SHALL provide clear feedback about connection failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend dependencies to be properly installed and configured, so that the development environment works consistently across different machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` THEN all required dependencies SHALL be installed without conflicts
2. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be no type errors that prevent the application from running
3. WHEN Vite builds the application THEN all imports SHALL be resolved correctly
4. WHEN Sentry integration is enabled THEN it SHALL not prevent the application from loading in development
5. IF there are version conflicts THEN they SHALL be resolved with compatible package versions
