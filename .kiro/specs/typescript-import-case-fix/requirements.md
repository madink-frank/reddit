# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin dashboard codebase has inconsistent import casing for UI components, specifically the Button component. Some files import from `'../ui/button'` (lowercase) while the actual file is `Button.tsx` (uppercase). This causes TypeScript compilation errors due to case sensitivity conflicts. We need to standardize all imports to match the actual file names.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent import statements throughout the codebase, so that TypeScript compilation works without case sensitivity errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles the project THEN there SHALL be no case sensitivity import errors
2. WHEN importing UI components THEN the import path SHALL match the actual file name casing
3. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN all Button component imports SHALL use uppercase 'Button'
4. WHEN reviewing import statements THEN all other UI component imports SHALL match their actual file names

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a systematic approach to identify and fix import inconsistencies, so that similar issues can be prevented in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all files with incorrect import casing
2. WHEN fixing imports THEN the system SHALL update all affected files consistently
3. WHEN the fix is complete THEN the TypeScript compiler SHALL run without case sensitivity warnings
4. WHEN the fix is complete THEN all import statements SHALL follow the established naming convention

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the fix doesn't break any existing functionality, so that the application continues to work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN imports are updated THEN all component functionality SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN the application runs THEN all UI components SHALL render correctly
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL complete successfully without errors
