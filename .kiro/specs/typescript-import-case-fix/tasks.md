# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and document the current import inconsistencies
  - Scan the codebase to identify all files importing Button with incorrect casing
  - Document the scope and impact of the issue
  - Create a comprehensive list of files that need to be updated
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 2. Fix Button component import statements
  - Update all imports from `'../ui/button'` to `'../ui/Button'` 
  - Update all imports from `'./button'` to `'./Button'`
  - Update all imports from `'@/components/ui/button'` to `'@/components/ui/Button'`
  - Handle any other variations of incorrect Button import paths
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Verify TypeScript compilation after Button fixes
  - Run TypeScript compiler to check for remaining case sensitivity errors
  - Identify any additional UI components with similar import issues
  - Document any remaining compilation issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_

- [x] 4. Fix any additional UI component import inconsistencies
  - Update imports for other UI components that have case sensitivity issues
  - Ensure all import statements match actual file names
  - Apply consistent naming convention across all UI component imports
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2_

- [x] 5. Run comprehensive testing to ensure functionality is preserved
  - Execute TypeScript compilation to verify no case sensitivity errors
  - Run the full test suite to ensure no functionality is broken
  - Perform manual testing of UI components in the application
  - Verify that the build process completes successfully
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 6. Document the fix and create prevention guidelines
  - Document the changes made and files affected
  - Create guidelines for consistent import naming
  - Consider adding linting rules to prevent future case sensitivity issues
  - Update development documentation with import best practices
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4_
