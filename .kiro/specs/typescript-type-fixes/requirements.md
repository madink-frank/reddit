# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The admin dashboard codebase contains several TypeScript type errors that prevent proper compilation and development. These errors include type mismatches in theme configuration, import path issues, and missing type declarations. This spec addresses the need to fix these TypeScript type errors to ensure a smooth development experience and proper type safety throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript type errors to be resolved, so that I can develop with proper type safety and without compilation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles the codebase THEN there SHALL be no type errors related to theme configuration
2. WHEN using theme mode values THEN they SHALL be properly typed as `ThemeMode` instead of generic `string`
3. WHEN importing modules THEN all import paths SHALL resolve correctly without module not found errors
4. WHEN using third-party libraries THEN all type declarations SHALL be available and properly configured
5. IF type mismatches occur THEN they SHALL be resolved with proper type assertions or interface updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for theme configuration, so that I can work with theme modes safely and get proper IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN toggling theme modes THEN the `newMode` variable SHALL be typed as `ThemeMode` not `string`
2. WHEN creating theme configurations THEN all properties SHALL match the `ThemeConfig` interface exactly
3. WHEN using theme utilities THEN they SHALL accept and return properly typed values
4. WHEN theme mode is 'light' or 'dark' THEN TypeScript SHALL recognize these as valid `ThemeMode` values
5. IF theme configuration is invalid THEN TypeScript SHALL provide compile-time errors with helpful messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import paths to be consistent and properly resolved, so that I don't encounter module resolution errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using relative imports THEN they SHALL be consistent throughout the codebase
2. WHEN importing from services THEN the paths SHALL use relative imports instead of `@/` aliases where not configured
3. WHEN importing UI components THEN the paths SHALL resolve correctly
4. WHEN importing utilities THEN they SHALL be available and properly typed
5. IF import paths are incorrect THEN the build process SHALL fail with clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all custom hooks and utilities, so that I get proper IntelliSense and type checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using custom hooks THEN they SHALL have proper return type definitions
2. WHEN using utility functions THEN their parameters and return types SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN using store functions THEN they SHALL have correct type signatures
4. WHEN using notification systems THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions
5. IF types are missing THEN they SHALL be added with comprehensive interface definitions
