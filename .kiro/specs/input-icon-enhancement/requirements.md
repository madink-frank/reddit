# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the Input component to support left and right icons, improving the visual design and user experience of form inputs. The enhancement will add icon support while maintaining backward compatibility and accessibility standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add icons to input fields, so that I can create more visually appealing and intuitive forms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer provides a `leftIcon` prop THEN the Input component SHALL display the icon on the left side of the input field
2. WHEN a developer provides a `rightIcon` prop THEN the Input component SHALL display the icon on the right side of the input field
3. WHEN both `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` are provided THEN the Input component SHALL display both icons in their respective positions
4. WHEN icons are present THEN the input text SHALL have appropriate padding to avoid overlapping with icons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want icon-enhanced inputs to maintain accessibility standards, so that all users can interact with the forms effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN icons are added to inputs THEN the icons SHALL be marked with `aria-hidden="true"` to prevent screen reader confusion
2. WHEN icons are interactive THEN they SHALL have proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
3. WHEN icons are decorative THEN they SHALL not interfere with screen reader navigation
4. WHEN focus is on the input THEN the focus ring SHALL encompass the entire input container including icons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want icon positioning to work correctly with different input variants and states, so that the design remains consistent across all use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN icons are used with different input variants (default, filled, outlined) THEN the icons SHALL be positioned correctly within each variant
2. WHEN icons are used with different input sizes (sm, md, lg) THEN the icon size SHALL scale appropriately
3. WHEN icons are used with error or success states THEN the state indicators SHALL not conflict with custom icons
4. WHEN right icons are provided along with error/success states THEN the state indicators SHALL take precedence and be positioned rightmost

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the icon enhancement to be backward compatible, so that existing Input components continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing Input components are used without icon props THEN they SHALL render exactly as before
2. WHEN the Input component is updated THEN all existing prop interfaces SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN new icon props are added THEN they SHALL be optional with undefined defaults
4. WHEN the component is imported THEN the existing API SHALL remain fully functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible icon support, so that I can use different types of icons and customize their appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing icons THEN the component SHALL accept React components (like Lucide icons)
2. WHEN providing icons THEN the component SHALL accept JSX elements
3. WHEN icons are rendered THEN they SHALL inherit appropriate color from the design system
4. WHEN icons need custom styling THEN developers SHALL be able to pass className props to icons
